HELP_MESSAGE = """Welcome to the Caesar Cipher app!\n
Change between English and Greek from the button on the top left.
Use the input panel to enter text.
Use Encode, Decode, Brute Force or AutoDecrypt to process your text.
!!! Make sure to choose a key when using Encode or Decode."
!!! Select the toggles you want to use (English, Greek, Symbols, Custom).\n
Encode:
Cycles through the alphabet a number of places to the left. That number is the key.\n
Decode:
Cycles through the alphabet a number of places to the right. The opposite process of Encode.\n
Brute Force:
Outputs all possible decryptions with their keys.
Uses only the leftmost toggle.
Recommended to use with only one Toggle on at a time.\n
AutoDecrypt:
Outputs all possible decryptions from most likely to least.
!!! Only works for decryption of coherent English words. Use with English or Custom toggles.
Results may not be perfect if the given text is too short.
May also provide accurate results for non-English text, using the basic Latin alphabet though not as
reliably. (French, German, Spanish etc.)\n
Symbols:
Cycles through the string:
`!1@2#3$4â‚¬%5^6&7*8(9)0_-+={[}]|:;"'<,>.?/ 
(there is a space in the end.)\n
Custom:
Input a string of characters to cycle through.
!!! Make sure all the characters are unique.
!!! Cannot be used with other toggles.\n
